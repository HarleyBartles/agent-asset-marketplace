# AGENTS.md

Scope: `tools/`

This scope covers repository validation and generation scripts.

Defer to the repository root `AGENTS.md` for global doctrine, publication
rules, and upstream-drain policy.

## Review guidelines

- Flag validators that can pass while indexed paths, plugin manifests, or
  registry entries have already drifted.
- Flag generator changes that are not paired with matching validation updates.
- Flag JSON or path parsing that could silently skip missing files, stale
  references, or unsupported plugin entries.
- Flag tooling changes that do not keep the marketplace export, repo index,
  and validation command documentation aligned.
